# Personal Backup Review

My personal CrashPlan subscription is expiring in January 2018.  I need to find a replacement backup solution.  
I currently have an Unlimited Family subscription with CrashPlan and backup ~5 machines with ~1.5TB of data.

## Requirements

1. High
    1. Cross platform - Mac and Linux at a minimum
    2. Custom encryption key
    3. Scheduled
2. Medium
    1. 3-2-1 Backup Strategy - 3 copies, two local on different devices, and one remote
    2. Central reporting (dashboard) or notifications
    3. CLI
